## Abstract

A virtual power plant (VPP) refers to an active aggregator of heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs), which creates a promising pathway to expand renewable energy and demand-side electrification for deep decarbonization. The VPP market is projected to have a significant growth potential, with the global investment surging from $6.47 billion in 2022 to $16.90 billion by 2030. Up to now, VPPs still face technical challenges in dealing with the inherent uncertainty of DERs, and data emerge as a promising and essential resource to handle this issue. This paper makes the first effort to review the development of VPP technologies from a data-centric perspective, and then analyze the major role of data within every decision phase of VPPs. We examine the VPP energy management through a data lifecycle lens, and extensively survey the progress in data creation, data communication, data-driven decision support, data sharing and privacy, as well as technical solutions stemming from reinforcement learning, peer-to-peer sharing, blockchain, and market participation. In addition, we offer a unique overview of open data and recent real-world projects around the world to showcase the latest VPP practices. We finally discuss the major challenges and future opportunities in detail, with a focus on topics such as public benchmarks, internet of things, 5G, explainable artificial intelligence, and federated learning. We highlight the need for technical advances in data management and support systems for the growing scale of future VPP systems, and suggest VPPs delivering more ancillary grid services in the future.
