Research Focus
==============

Our research focuses on advanced energy system modelling, which has proven to be highly valuable in providing a comprehensive assessment of future low-carbon energy systems. These modelling techniques cover various aspects, including electricity, heat, gas, and transport. My research has made significant contributions by creating novel market-driven approaches and modelling methodologies that have been widely applied to analyse and evaluate key performance indicators such as energy costs, carbon emissions, and ancillary services. These contributions have significantly advanced the understanding of the complexities and opportunities within future energy systems.

Technology Integration and Innovation
=====================================

A central aspect of my work is the integration and valuation of emerging technologies, including flexible demand, energy storage, electric vehicles, microgrids, and mobile sources. I am also particularly leading efforts in applying AI-driven reinforcement learning to tackle a range of challenges in power and energy systems, with the aim of improving operational efficiency, flexibility, and market design, towards a resilient low-carbon energy future.

Research Methodologies
======================

My research employs cutting-edge modelling techniques that span multiple energy vectors, providing holistic insights into the interactions between different energy systems. The work involves developing sophisticated mathematical models and computational frameworks that can handle the complexity of modern energy networks while maintaining practical applicability.

Impact and Applications
=======================

The research outcomes have direct applications in policy making, energy planning, and system optimization. By combining traditional energy system analysis with modern AI techniques, my work contributes to the transition towards sustainable and resilient energy systems that can meet the challenges of climate change and energy security.
