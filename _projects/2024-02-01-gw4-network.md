## Project Overview

**Principal Investigator:** Dawei Qiu  
**Co-Investigators:** Zhong Fan, Meysam Qadrdan, Laiz Souto, Furong Li, Bethan Charles, Jianhong Wang, Ruzanna Chitchyan

**Funder:** GW4 Generator Fund Round 6 [[webpage](https://gw4.ac.uk/generator-fund/){:target="_blank"}]  
**Funding:** £20,000

## Project Description

This community addresses the critical challenge of ensuring real-time grid stability and resilience as the UK accelerates its net-zero transition through large-scale renewable integration and electrification of heating and transport. With rising vulnerabilities from climate-induced extreme weather events, the project focuses on leveraging decentralised flexible resources—such as distributed energy systems and microgrids—through advanced AI-driven modelling, market mechanisms, and control strategies. 

## Project Goals

The goal is to create transformative digital solutions that enhance the resilience and cost-effectiveness of future low-carbon energy systems, supporting the UK's leadership in sustainable and secure energy transitions.

## Key Research Areas

- **Real-time grid stability** and resilience enhancement
- **Large-scale renewable integration** and management
- **Electrification** of heating and transport systems
- **Decentralised flexible resources** coordination
- **AI-driven modelling** and control strategies
- **Market mechanisms** for energy transition
