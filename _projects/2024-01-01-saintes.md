## Project Description

This project is working on energy system optimisation through the development of AI-based decision support tools that are safe, scalable, and economically efficient. The objective is to develop trustworthy and safe AI algorithms specifically tailored for energy system optimisation. The project includes three main activities:

1. **Physics-informed reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm** to solve optimal power flow (OPF)
2. **Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm** for coordinating large populations of DERs
3. **Integration into a digital twin whole-system energy model** for testing and validation
